Retail Sales Analysis â€“ SQL Project

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Title: Retail Sales Analysis

Level: Beginner

Database Name: sql\_project\_p1

This project aims to help beginners develop essential SQL skills by analyzing real-world retail sales data. You'll learn how to create and manage a database, clean and explore data, and answer key business questions through SQL queries. It's a hands-on exercise designed for aspiring data analysts looking to build a strong foundation in SQL.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database and load the provided retail sales dataset.

Data Cleaning

Identify and remove records with missing or null values to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform basic analysis to understand data distribution, trends, and patterns.

Business Analysis

Use SQL to answer specific business questions, uncover insights, and support decision-making.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

1\. Database Setup

Create Database: Start by creating a new database named sql\_project\_p1.

Create Table: Define and create a table called retail\_sales to store the dataset.

The table includes the following columns:

transaction\_id: Unique ID for each transaction

sale\_date: Date of the transaction

sale\_time: Time of the transaction

customer\_id: Unique ID of the customer

gender: Gender of the customer

age: Age of the customer

category: Product category

quantity: Quantity of products sold

price\_per\_unit: Price of a single unit

cogs: Cost of Goods Sold

total\_sale: Total sale amount
